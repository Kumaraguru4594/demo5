🧾 Summary

The session focused on failover mechanisms, system behavior under abrupt interruptions, and message handling during infrastructure-level recovery in the newly containerized WebMethods setup. NGINX, UM, and NAS behaviors were specifically discussed.


---

✅ Key Discussion Points

🔁 Failover Design

Failover is currently tested and validated only on the HK side.

Failover scenarios are covered at:

NGINX level

Application (AP) level

Pod level



🌐 NGINX Behavior

HK NGINX setup is active-passive, with automatic switchovers when primary fails.

UM is also in active-passive configuration.


⚙️ UM Monitoring Script

A shell script checks UM's exit code every 5 minutes.

If UM fails abruptly, the script restarts UM in server 03.

Server 00 is always intended to be the primary UM instance.


📝 NAS Behavior

UM writes to NAS by the 3rd minute after start.

Current NAS usage already exceeds 20 GB — may require cleanup or expansion.



---

❓ Questions Raised

1. Hardware Configuration Clarity

Confirmed:

16-core setup, 128 GB RAM

32 + 32 = 64 GB (application allocation?)

Memory block: 256 + 256 = 512 GB + 128 GB (possibly across nodes)




2. Recovery Delay

Script runs every 5 minutes — considered too long for real-time recovery.



3. Message Reliability

Will there be message loss if UM goes down suddenly and recovers on another node?



4. Load Testing Timing

Will load testing be performed before or after recovery test?



5. Resubmission Behavior

In case of failure, will message resubmission succeed, or require manual intervention?

Noted: manual stop/start may fail for messages in-transit.





---

🚩 Risks & Observations

Delayed failover (5 mins) may lead to:

In-transit message failures

Duplicate processing (if resubmission is manual)


NAS capacity must be reviewed and possibly expanded before full HA testing.

No confirmation yet on testing UM failover on SG region.
